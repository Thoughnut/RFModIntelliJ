The RF mod is based on a group of friends from the Netherlands.

It all starting when the boys met each other at McDonalds. From there on forward, the so called MBC became a big thing.
MBC stands for MacBurgerChicken and is an abbreviation for a weekly event in the city of Veenendaal. The boys would take
their appetizer at McDonalds, the main course at KFC and the desert at Burger King.

At some point in time they started playing minecraft, a game full of blocks and fun!
It took a while for all of them to start playing the game, but eventually everyone was there.
But at some point the game lost a lot of it's fun and it needed some extra playability.
At this point we introduce the RF Mod to add more fun into minecraft!

I hope you enjoy,

Thoughnut
